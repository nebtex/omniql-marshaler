# omniql-marshaler
transform json, yml to omniql/hybrids and vice versa


approach
===


the initial approach consist in use **the most popular way** to marshall json data in every language,
if  almagest reach a stable release and become popular,  it probably will need to use an approach similar,
to easyjson  https://github.com/mailru/easyjson, to improve the performance 5-6x.


anyway the most demanding task that will depends of  this marshaller is probably the future swagger-omniql gateway.
